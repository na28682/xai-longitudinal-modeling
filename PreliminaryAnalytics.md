# DarkBrickProductions - TENET LEGO Trailer Analytics

This project analyzes the performance of my most popular video: **"TENET - New Trailer in LEGO"**.  
The dataset tracks daily views since the video was published, highlights high-performance days (top view counts), and adds contextual information such as weekday and month for trend analysis.
